2020, you’ve sucked, but you’ve also taught me a lot.

Last January, we were presented with a level-4 eruption that affected the livelihood of thousands of Filipinos all throughout Luzon. Then 2-weeks after that, COVID-19 presents itself to us in the form of a virus that transmits itself faster than our government can take action.

Not only affecting those in the Philippines but everyone globally: constant layoffs, operations on-hold, closing businesses and lost lives. It’s a tough time to be alive and more so building a business.

When founding the startup, I knew things would be difficult. Still, like all the other business owners, I did not expect a possible downturn in the economy.

Being an entrepreneur building [Avion School](www.avionschool.com), a school that teaches Filipinos to become software engineers in 12 weeks, we also needed to adapt. Not just making our classes online, but even the way we work as a team.

So we launched our first batch online and prepared to be purely remote.

As a founder having worked in non-remote environments, I knew shifting our whole operations online wouldn’t be easy but still doable.

The reality is working, let alone running a business, during a lockdown is challenging. Here are my tips on making the transition to remote work.

## How to win at running a purely remote startup

All this may be coming from the perspective of someone running a tech startup, but I do believe a lot of these tips do work for other types of businesses as well. <em>Use them wisely</em>.

1. **Realize you’ve already done it to an extent.** During the start of our transition to remote work, it was scary to think about the idea that work wouldn’t get done. We never actually had an office, but we did work together in coffee shops — and work got done. Then I thought about how that only covered a small part of our day. Majority of our actual work was getting done in the morning or at night, at times we were most productive. Realizing that things were getting done outside of our personal interactions paved the way for the shift to remote work.
2. **Low overhead cost. Happier employees. More work is done.** Let’s consider two realities: office space is expensive, and traffic is everywhere. One consideration for startup success is to build a beautiful office space, and that’s what I did in the first startup I ran. We got a nice office in central BGC only to realize that my team members were commuting 3–4 hours in total daily. As frustrating as it was for them, it was equally as frustrating to me knowing that they were not able to do their best work due to how tired they were. We can all assume how this turned out.</li>
3. **Trust that you’ve made the right hiring decisions.** This stems from the question, “how do I know they’re working if I can’t seem them physically?” As a founder or manager, your main job is to find the right people that best fit the needs of your company. These are the types of employees that will help you grow your business. Truth be told, if you can’t trust that your team will deliver on the work given to them, then they might not be the right hires for you. The best employees can balance their personal lives and the work required. Trust that you’ve hired the right people.
4. **Work can’t be done at home, there’s just too much distraction.** This goes back to the aspect of trusting your team that they know their responsibilities and will deliver on that. This has gotten to me many times in the past few months, and I’ve always been proven wrong. People will always have the inclination to do work for as long as it’s exciting, challenging and relevant to the overall goal. This is just the reality of how human beings are wired — especially adults.
5. **Developing culture when there’s no in-person interaction.** One way to go about this is by maintaining clear communication. Within Avion School, the way that we do this is by building a culture of constant communication amongst both the students and team members. We celebrate each other’s successes, communicate our faults openly and over-communicate everything that is happening. As [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://twitter.com/dhh) puts it, “The best cultures derive from actions people actually take, not the ones they write about in a mission statement.”
6. **Collaborating through technology.** We’re fortunate to have tools that enhance our experience of working as a team. Here are a couple free ones that you may want to check out: [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and [Tandem](https://tandem.chat/coronavirus) (for meetings); [Asana](https://asana.com/) and [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) (for task management); [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) (for note management); and your trusty old [Google Suite](https://gsuite.google.com.ph/intl/en_ph/).
7. **Taking a different approach to determining productivity.** We’ve been living in a work environment where the productivity is measured through how early or late the employee leaves, how many in-person meetings are set and, sadly, office politics. When it comes to remote work, the only measure of productivity is the work produced. Which, quite frankly, what you as a founder or manager would want employees to be judged for because this helps drive actual progress.
8. **Changing the way that you hire.** Now that you’re judging productivity through actual work delivered, you may want to consider doing the same for your hires. At Avion School, the main channel we use to judge our job candidates is by having them go through a trial period where they do actual work that drives business progress alongside team members of the function involved. This way, the candidate you’re looking into is immersed in the culture of work. They can see if they are a good fit for your startup. Doing a couple rounds of calls via Zoom does help out with this too.
9. **Your job is to make sure that they’re able to deliver.** As a founder, part of your job is to make sure that your team can deliver on what’s needed to push the business forward. I’ve learned this the hard way too many times. Either I’ve spent placing in too much work that our team can’t manage to deliver on everything, or I’ve done too little delegation, which is just as bad for morale. Working remotely, you need to know the ins and outs of what you’re having the team work on. This is because you won’t be there to watch every move of your employees. Do this right, and the benefits are great!
10. **We are humans, and we thrive through social interaction.** Things may be remote within the company, but don’t forget that getting together in-person is still something that can be done. So every few weeks, spend time with one another even if it’s outside of work. Once this lockdown is over, don’t hesitate to treat your team to a lunch out.

The reality is that we’re all experiencing tough times right now.

What will help us see things through is being able to maintain focus on the important things that keep the business alive. Executing and maintaining the proper practices of remote work is one way to do help enhance that.

If you have friends or know anyone struggling to grow a business through these trying times, please share this post with them. You just might be the reason why they didn’t stop trying to make the world better.

A lot of the principles here are from the book [Remote by DHH](https://basecamp.com/books/remote), which has been instrumental for us being able to make the shift right.
