Hi there — Victor here! 👋🏽 An aspiring entrepreneur learning to build the future.

Ever since I was young, I never liked the idea of social norms. While all my batchmates were into video games or basketball, I wanted to be a rapper. I could never rap but I did dress the part — oversized shirts, bling bling and bandanas. I was 9 #ThugLife 😎. For whatever reason, I would always find the thing no one ever seemed to be interested in.

In college, one particular thing did catch my interest — how the educational system needed a lot of improvement. It’s something I still feel strongly about today. My belief was that, while college was a good step to become a successful person, it was not the only way. I stood by this firmly for years. Took this to heart so much that when a professor told my class: “I don’t understand how some CEOs become CEOs if they don’t have an MBA. It makes me doubt their abilities,” I left the room and decided to drop out that night.

I write this new blog to give a little bit more of clarity on why I did what I did and use this as a measure of progress for the new decade. So this is me.

My life revolves around understanding why people do what they do. More specifically, I love to hear stories about startups and passion projects of Filipinos because they allow me to find ways I can help them scale those ideas. Something I get to do on a daily basis while running Customer Success and Growth Marketing for PayMongo (YC S19).

I used to live by a mantra, “When I’m awake, I’m either working or working out.” Although less of the working out nowadays — and I say this to force myself to start again. 😅 For now, let’s keep it at, “When I’m awake, I’m either working or writing a blog”. It’s a little less catchy but it does help transition over to what you can expect to see here!

📖 **Things I’ve learned to do (or not to do…)**

In the pursuit of getting better, the thing I’ve realized is that becoming a person worthy of admiration is a process of learning. And one way I’ve been taught to strengthen the things I’ve learned into my brain is being able to teach it. So expect a lot of new and random insights I hope you would find useful too!

🚀 **Growth Marketing and Customer Success**

Doing two very “Silicon Valley” roles in the Philippines is challenging! Not being as common as other roles, these functions of a business should be pushed a lot more locally. The reason being is that they initiate a shift in mindset that local companies are capable of scale too.

🌏 **World news, economics, politics and history**

If you know me, these are topics I’ve always avoided for the simple reason that I know nothing about them. In this case, this blog is a step towards learning more about what happens outside Manila. Being able to look outside what you’re used to — in my case, tech — you are able make unique connections that lead to the big problems worthy of solving.

More than just being able to share topics that interest me — and more so things my readers would find even more interesting — is to actually build a site that people can access information they can share or use in their life too. If I get to do that, then hey I did my job as a now “blogger.”

Welcome to my blog, and here’s to the next decade of growth. 🥂
